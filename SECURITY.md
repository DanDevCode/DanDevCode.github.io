## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find vulnerabilities, report it in detail as: What happened?, When did it happen? And where do I go?

## Why does it have flaws?

The reason for this is either because its support has ended or because the version is unstable. The best thing to do to avoid these errors is to stay on a stable version. Errors that can occur:
<br>
<li>The page does not load correctly</li>
<li>Errors 404, 505 or more HTTP errors for no reason</li>
<li>You cannot access the page</li>

NOTE: Sometimes the errors come from your device.
